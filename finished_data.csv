This represents a limited functional capacity for his age. He complained of chest discomfort with breathing at peak exercise, which resolved immediately with rest. There was no significant ST segment changes noted with exercise or recovery. The rhythm was sinus with frequent PVC's, sustained ventricular bigemeny and occasional ventricular couplets all occurring at low levels of exercise and resolved in immediate recovery. There was hypertension at rest with an exaggerated blood pressure response to low level exercise. The heart rate responded appropriately to the level of exercise performed. IMPRESSION: No significant ST segment changes noted. Sudden onset of ventricular ectopy at low workloads accompanied by difficult breathing. Limited functional capacity demonstrated. \n\nTTE ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet (late systolic jet) of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCardiac Catheterization ___:\n1. Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system demonstrated no obstructive coronary artery disease. The vessels were ectatic. The LAD had a short intramyocardial segment in the \nmid-vessel which induced a 40% stenosis. \n2. Resting hemodynamics revealed slightly normal left heart filling \npresssures and slightly elevated right heart filling pressures. The RVEDP and LVEDP were equal at 14mmHg. There was mild pulmonary hypertension with diastolic pressures equal to LVEDP and RVEDP. The pattern was consistent with restrictive/constrictive physiology. \n3.

Low lung volumes limit evaluation. There are bilateral pulmonary opacities which are most confluent in the lung bases. Central pulmonary hilar engorgement with interstitial and alveolar edema is present. Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate. No pneumothorax.

ST segments depressed in I, AVL, V6 but unchaged from prior EKG.\n"", ""input6"": ""ECHO: The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis, inferior akinesis/hypokinesis and apical hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  On color Doppler imaging, there is an interatrial shunt consistent with stretched PFO or an atrial septal defect. (Images of the interatrial septum were suboptimal in the prior study). Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), the mid anterolateral wall now appears more hypokinetic and the anterior apex is now hypokinetic (may have been foreshortened in the prior study). The aortic valve gradient is similar. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %)\n""}"

There is no definite superimposed edema. Again noted is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged but stable. No displaced fractures are evident.

No definite dilated loops of small bowel are evident. There is stool throughout the descending colon. No abnormal calcifications are noted overlying the renal fossae.

There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right with associated atelectasis. Marked cardiomegaly is additionally noted. An 8-mm low-attenuation focus within the left lobe of the liver is too small to characterize but likely represents a simple cyst (2:21). Similarly, a 7-mm low-attenuation focus in the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize but also likely represents a simple cyst (2:26). The liver is otherwise unremarkable. Please note, moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites also limits detailed evaluation. The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and abdominal portions of the small bowel appear grossly unremarkable. There are bilateral simple renal cysts, the largest of which is located at the upper pole of the right kidney and measures 5.3 cm in diameter (2:20). The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable.

Appropriate hemodynamic response to infusion and recovery. The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg IV aminophylline.\n\nTTE ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve leaflets are not well visualized. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic function. Well seated aortic valve bioprosthesisleft with increased transaortic gradients, likely secondary to incrased flow from high output versus patient/prosthesis mismatch (similar mean gradient reported on post-op TEE. True prosthesis stenosis is less likely given the early peaking contour of the transaortic jet velocity (AT < 100 ms), although cannot completely exclude.\n""}"

Upon evaluation by Dr. was felt that she could be experiencing another flare despite her pregnancy, and an admission was recommended, however patient decided to leave AMA. \n\ufeff\nShe states that a few hours after finishing her first infusion, she started to develop a sensation of her left side feeling \""off\"" which she has difficulty describing, but endorses is difficulty functioning with her left hand, for example she is missing keys while texting on her phone. She is also experiencing tingling in the hand. She also endorses that her coordination and balance are \""off\"", and that she has to hold on to walls while ambulating. This is new for her. She also had a sensation that her left eye \""wants to be closed\"", but she denies any vision loss, blurred vision, or double vision.\n\ufeff\nInitially she attributed these symptoms to a side effect of solumedrol, however this morning she continued to experience them, and concerned, she called the on-call neurology resident who advised her to come to the ED for evaluation. She is not certain that the symptoms are getting worse, but they are certainly not improving.\n\ufeff\n"", ""input3"": ""+ Asthma \n+ Lactose intolerance\n+ Ovarian cyst s/p removal\n+ Back Pain \n+ Dysmenorrhea \n+ Lymphocytic colitis, controlled constipation  \n+ IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)  \n+ Postpartum hemorrhage\n"", ""input4"": ""3 aunts with lupus uncle: DVT, Maternal grandmother: \""epileptic\""\n"", ""input5"": ""ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:\nGeneral: awake, cooperative, NAD.\nHEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx\nNeck: supple, no nuchal rigidity\nPulmonary: breathing comfortably on room air\nCardiac: RRR, nl\nAbdomen: soft, NT/ND\nExtremities: warm, well perfused\nSkin: no rashes or lesions noted\n\ufeff\nNeurologic:\n\ufeff\n-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3.

She complained of mild mid-sternal to left shoulder pressure at peak exercise, which resolved almost completely by 5 minutes of recovery with the remaining discomfort only occuring with palpation. In the presence of RBBB on baseline ECG, there were no changes in ST segment or T wave morphology noted during exercise or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with one isolated PVC seen during exercise and one ventricular couplet seen in immediate recovery. The heart rate and blood pressure responses were mildly blunted (beta blockade). \n  \n___ CXR:\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. \n  \n___ ECHO bedside:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded - it appears that the inferior wall may be hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a complete transthoracic examination with Doppler is recommended. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed), right ventricle is slightly larger. Regional left ventricular function cannot be reliably assessed on this emergency study.\n\nECG:\nnon-ST-elevation\n""}"

He is currently pain free.  \n\ufeff\nHe does not generally experience exertional chest pain but beginning about two weeks ago he began to experience chest pain while on his treadmill and improving with rest.  He had not required any NTGs.\n\ufeff\nPer documentation, he had onset of pressure across his anterior chest occurring at rest and was taken by EMS. Apparently, his chest symptoms resolved after having been given additional aspirin in about one hour. He has no recall having  been given nitroglycerin. In the ED, ECG was reported as normal  and troponin slightly elevated to 0.133 (top normal at 0.045).  \nD-dimer was negative. Renal function was normal. Because of the elevated troponin, he was advised to have immediate cardiac catheterization, but signed out against advice and came to see \nDr. at his regularly scheduled appointment.\n \nIn the ED, initial vitals were 76 128/65 16 100% RA. Labs notable for chem 7 wnl, Hgb 13.1, plt 149, trop <0.01. ECG showed sinus rhythm without STTW changes.  CXR showed no acute process.  \n\ufeff\nSeen by cardiology who recommended admission and cardiac cath in the AM.\n\ufeff\nCurrently, he reports feeling well and denies chest pain.  He has no complaints.\n\ufeff\nROS positive for 3 pillow orthopnea which has been stable \""for years\""\n\ufeff\nOn review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional extremity pain.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction. \n\ufeff\nCXR showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. \n\ufeff\nETT stress\nTerminated for chest discomfort at min 4.5 with 0.5 mm horizontal STD V4-V6 and drop in BP with total METs. CP resolved with rest\n\ufeff\nCardiac Catheterization\nLMCA was patent, LAD had mild plaquing proximally to 20% after S1. diagnoal branch had slow flow. Mid LAD had 40% stenosis just after D1, followed by a tapering (likely recanalized) total occlusion with TIMI 1 flow into the lesion and essentially TIMI 0 flow w/ faint contrast retention beyone from competitive flow from right to left collaterals. Ramus intermedius had mild plaquing and slightly delayed pulsatile flow. LCx was patent, RCA not imaged. LAD had drug eluting stent placed.\n""}"

The patient exercised for 5 minutes of a Modified protocol and was stopped for fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 3.8, which represents a poor exercise tolerance for her age. There were no reports of chest, back, neck, or arm discomforts during the study. Dyspnea was noted throughout exercise which improved during recovery. There were no significant ST segment changes noted during exercise or early recovery. After 3 minutes of recovery, the facility lost power and EKGs were not acquired for the remainder of the study. Rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated VPBs and rare isolated APBs. The heart rate response was appropriate during exercise and recovery. Mild resting hypertension with an appropriate blood pressure response to exercise. \nIMPRESSION: Poor functional capacity. No anginal type symptoms \nor ischemic EKG changes. Mild resting hypertension.

This level of exercise represents a poor exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details). There is resting hypertension. There were normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to stress. \nResting images were acquired at a heart rate of 74 bpm and a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. These demonstrated normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrated no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient. \nEcho images were acquired within 45 seconds after peak stress at heart rates of 136 - 116 bpm. These demonstrated new regional dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the mid- and distal segments of the anterior wall, septum as the apex (mid-LAD territory). The remaining segments augment appropriately. There was augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. \n\ufeff\nIMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity.

LINE PLACEM\nIMPRESSION:  \nIn comparison to radiograph, a right internal jugular central venous catheter is been placed, terminating in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Slight widening of the mediastinum is likely due to accentation of a tortuous thoracic aorta by patient rotation and supine portable technique, but a repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful to confirm this impression when the patient's condition permits.  Lungs are clear except for minor atelectasis at the left lung base. \n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) \nIMPRESSION: \nAs compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, there has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the chest except for slight \nimprovement in minor left basilar atelectasis. \n\nFEMORAL VASCULAR US RIG\nIMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula and the right groin. \n2. Organized hematoma in the right groin measuring up to 7 cm. \n3. No drainable fluid collection. \n  \nCT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.   Infrarenal fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to is 4.7 cm in maximum diameter without evidence of aneurysmal leak, impending or contained rupture.  Recommend follow-up CT at 6 month interval. \n2.   Status post LHC complicated by a right arterial groin bleed.  6.7 x 2.3 cm area of increased density in the anteromedial aspect of right thigh with extensive soft tissue stranding and edema, most consistent with a soft tissue hematoma.  No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. \n3.  Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. \n4.  Focal consolidation of the apex of the left upper lobe, likely related to scarring from chronic parenchymal disease. \n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) \nFINDINGS:  \nCardiomegaly is a stable.  The patient is rotated, this accentuates the widened mediastinum and tortuous aorta.  Improving left lower lobe atelectasis, otherwise the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC\n""}"

There were 2 short OM1 and OM2 branches with no obvious perfusion of the high lateral wall (raising the possibility of an occluded ramus intermedius branch). The major OM3/LPL1 had an origin tubular 70% stenosis. LPL2 was subtotally occluded proximally and reconstituted via left-to-left collaterals with distal moderate disease at a bifurcation and TIM1 flow. The distal CX supplied collaterals to the diseased RPDA and RCA with retrograde filling up to the mid RCA. The LPDA was somewhat tortuous.\n  RCA: The RCA was occluded proximally past the conus and SA nodal branches. There was no reconstitution of the native RCA beyond.\n\n___ CXR \nThere is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration. The aorta is unfolded.  There is possible minimal upper zone re-distribution, but no other evidence of CHF.  No focal infiltrate or effusion.  No pneumothorax detected. Increased opacity adjacent to the left cardiac apex/left costophrenic angle most likely is related to a cardiac fat pad and/or overlying soft tissues. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  No acute pulmonary process identified.\n""}"

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.   \n\nCTA Chest:\nIMPRESSION:  \n  \n1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic \nabnormality.  No pleural effusions. \n2.  Mucous plugging in bilateral airways, most substantial in the left upper lobe. No evidence of lobar collapse on the \ncurrent study. \n3.  Left lower lobe opacities with mild adjacent \nbronchial wall thickening, a nonspecific finding that can be seen in the setting of micro-aspiration or atypical infection. \n4.  8 x 10 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule with somewhat\nspiculated margins, suspicious for malignancy. \n5.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, most prominent in the hilar and subcarinal stations, suggesting underlying systemic process.\n\nPost-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC = 0.43.\nFEV1 45%\n""}"
